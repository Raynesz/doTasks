# doTasks
A simple to-do application for Android devices made with React Native.

![Showcase](./assets/showcase.jpg "The app")

Being my first project in React Native, I used mattfrances' [tutorial](https://github.com/mattfrances/simpleReactNativeTodoList) as a starting point. The app is now written in TypeScript, uses color code to mark a task's state, can store the tasks in device memory and can select multiple tasks for deletion, with drag-n-dron sorting, possibly, coming in a future version. 

It has only been tested on an Android device. Being a small hobby project, the app is not activaly maintained, so if you decide to use it, then please do so at your discretion.
